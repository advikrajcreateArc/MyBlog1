      <h2 data-aos="fade-down">Who I Am</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        I'm Vivek Raj — a dreamer turned doer. I come from a background that didn’t involve elite institutions, tech mentors, or capital resources. My strength was my mindset — a relentless, restless energy that pushed me to believe in possibilities even when nothing seemed possible. My journey didn’t begin in boardrooms or incubators. It started in silence, in struggle, and in solitude.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-left">
        From an early age, I was always curious — not just about how things work, but how people break through. Why do some succeed and others don’t? What makes a person create despite constraints? That curiosity led me not toward textbooks but toward building, failing, and trying again. I learned from every small attempt, from every project that didn’t work, and from every voice that told me I wasn’t enough. I decided to prove them wrong — not by fighting them, but by building something undeniable.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        I didn’t know how to code. I didn’t know design. But I knew how to stay up when everyone else had gone to bed. I knew how to read, learn, and repeat. Eventually, that stubbornness evolved into structure — a structure that became CreateArc, my first ever product, company, and movement. It was born not from luxury, but from necessity — because if I didn’t build it, no one else would.
      </p>

      <h3 data-aos="zoom-in">What Drives Me</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        Every day, I wake up with one belief — that underdogs deserve tools too. The current world celebrates polished portfolios, fancy presentations, and curated networks. But what about those of us with raw ideas and no backing? CreateArc was my way of saying — you don’t need perfection to start. You just need courage. I’ve made it my mission to remove excuses for creators. If someone has the spark, I want them to have the fuel.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-left">
        I've been underestimated, mocked, told to "get a job" instead of "chasing dreams." But every insult was secretly a gift. It made me sharper, stronger, and more focused. I realized that if you want the world to respect your story — you have to first believe it’s worth telling. And that’s what I want everyone who uses CreateArc to feel: that their vision, no matter how small or scrappy, deserves a stage.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        My goal isn't to just build tools — it's to build confidence. Whether it's a 19-year-old building a pitch deck or a 45-year-old switching careers, I want people to feel seen, heard, and empowered. I want to simplify the complex — to let AI do the heavy lifting, while people bring their creativity and fire to the front.
      </p>

      <h3 data-aos="zoom-in">The Journey So Far</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        Building CreateArc wasn’t easy. There were nights I questioned everything — the vision, the effort, the sacrifices. But in those dark moments, I realized something powerful: clarity doesn’t always come before action. Sometimes you act first, and the clarity finds you later. I kept building, kept learning, and eventually, I saw a system forming. Users started connecting. Feedback came in. Suddenly, it wasn’t just my journey — it was ours.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-left">
        CreateArc is no longer just a tool. It’s a tribe. It’s a signal to every hustler who feels like they’re doing too much, yet never enough — that they are not alone. I see CreateArc as a place where ideas find their structure, dreams get their slides, and effort finds its expression. 
      </p>

      <h3 data-aos="zoom-in">What’s Next</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        I’m not stopping here. The vision for CreateArc includes AI that thinks like you, responds to your industry, and builds content as if you wrote it yourself. I’m working on offline access, real-time collaboration, voice-to-slide inputs, and even analytics that give feedback like a mentor. This is just the beginning.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        If you're reading this, I want you to know one thing — your background does not define your future. If you’ve been told you can’t, that just means you must. If you’ve been silent, now is the time to speak through your creations. I’m building CreateArc for people like you — and I promise to keep evolving it, just like I keep evolving myself.
      </p>

      <h3 data-aos="zoom-in">Final Words</h3>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        I’m not perfect. I’m not even polished. But I’m present — with heart, honesty, and hustle. That’s how I show up every day. And if I can do this, so can you. So let’s break the rules. Let’s ignore the doubters. Let’s create something so bold the world has to notice.
