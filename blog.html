      <h3><a href="#">From Struggle to Startup</a></h3>
      <p>
        The early journey of CreateArc wasn’t just about creating a product — it was about creating purpose. I didn’t come from a tech background. I didn’t know design or code when I began. But I knew how it felt to be left behind. This blog is about how I turned that frustration into fire, how every night without sleep became a day of progress. It’s not a story of overnight success — it’s a story of relentless learning. From watching free YouTube tutorials to analyzing investor pitch decks of billion-dollar startups, I carved my way forward. And today, CreateArc stands as a tool that was built not just with tech — but with truth.

      <h3><a href="#">Designing Decks That Win</a></h3>
      <p>
        The real power of a pitch deck doesn’t come from flashy visuals — it comes from clarity. This post dives into how AI in CreateArc helps users — even beginners — organize thoughts, map market opportunity, and tell a compelling story slide-by-slide. I share the framework I built after studying over 100 real decks and investor interviews. Whether you're a student, a freelancer, or a founder, this post shows how your message can be shaped into something that commands attention and respect, without expensive tools or a design background.

      <h3><a href="#">The Solo Founder Mindset</a></h3>
      <p>
        People often say you need a cofounder, a team, or a network to build something big. But this blog argues otherwise. I talk about what it means to stay committed when nobody's watching, to work silently when nobody's applauding, and to move forward when doubt surrounds you. From managing burnout to finding micro wins, this post is a deep reflection on what it's like to build a startup alone — and how to stay mentally strong through it. Because being solo doesn’t mean being small. Sometimes, it means being unstoppable.
