      <h2 data-aos="fade-down">My Journey: From Being Underestimated to Building CreateArc</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-right"><em>By Vivek Raj – Last updated June 2025</em></p>

      <p data-aos="fade-left">
        I wasn’t born with a silver spoon. I wasn’t born with code in my blood or capital in my bank. But I was born with something rarer — a fire. A stubborn, often painful fire that refused to let me sleep when I had dreams that demanded building. A voice inside that kept repeating: “Tu rukega toh tu hi haarega.” I didn’t have investors. I didn’t have a startup background. I didn’t even have a tech degree. But what I had — was a dream that wouldn’t leave me alone.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        Coming from a non-IT background in a world obsessed with degrees and connections, I was always told, “Yeh tere bas ka nahi.” But you know what? Every "no" I heard became fuel. Every rejection made my resolve harder. I didn’t know React, Tailwind, or Python — but I knew my vision. I knew what it felt like to be an outsider. I knew the pain of being doubted, dismissed, underestimated. That pain became my purpose.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        In 2025, while people around me chased stability, I decided to chase uncertainty. I didn’t want a safe job. I wanted to create jobs. I wanted to build something real — something that would let others like me dream freely and create fearlessly. That’s how CreateArc was born. It didn’t start as a company — it started as a commitment. A promise to myself that I won’t live a life of "what ifs".
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-left">
        I started by doing the impossible — an 80-slide investor pitch deck, alone. No designer. No cofounder. No mentor. Just me, a blank screen, and a refusal to give up. I learned structure, design, financial logic, storytelling, and business models all in one sleepless stretch. I would spend hours analyzing the decks of unicorn startups, watching tutorials at 2 AM, and rewriting slides until they made sense not just to an investor — but to me.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        And then I thought — why can't others do this too? What if a platform could help people generate world-class documents, plans, and decks — even if they had zero experience? What if every hustler could feel like a founder, and every student could pitch like a CEO? That’s CreateArc. Not just an AI tool. Not just a SaaS product. But a rebellion against gatekeeping.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        I’ve had days with no electricity, nights with no answers, and mornings with doubt. But I never let any of that stop me. People said, “Ek aadmi startup nahi chala sakta.” I said, “Ek aadmi bhi history bana sakta hai.” I didn’t wait for cofounders — I became my own team. I was the founder, designer, copywriter, developer, and user support — all at once. Not because I wanted to be — but because I had to be.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-left">
        CreateArc isn’t just a tool — it’s proof. That mindset > degree. That courage > comfort. That if you don’t get a seat at the table, you build your own damn table. It’s for the student with no portfolio but big ambition. It’s for the small-town hustler with startup dreams. It’s for the solo founder staring at a blank slide and wondering where to start.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        My mission is to democratize access to powerful business documents — without needing design agencies, expensive software, or long learning curves. With CreateArc, you don’t just generate a deck — you declare your intention to the world. And the platform stands with you.
      </p>

      <h3 data-aos="zoom-in">The Real Goal: A Platform for the Underdogs</h3>

      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        I’m not doing this for vanity. I’m doing this for that guy who’s laughed at for dreaming too big. For that girl who’s told she needs connections to be successful. For that student who has an idea but not a voice. I want CreateArc to be that voice. That tool. That revolution. And I will keep refining it — until it becomes the weapon every underdog deserves.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-left">
        I want this to be a place where business meets belief. Where startup decks don’t need ₹50,000 agencies. Where your passion is enough to start. I want students to create resume decks that get attention. I want freelancers to pitch clients with style. I want NGOs to present their vision with dignity. 
      </p>

      <h3 data-aos="zoom-in">What’s Next?</h3>

      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        I’m launching CreateArc with a clear plan: offer insane value even in the free version. Let people build their first pitch with AI. Let founders test their GTM. Let students make their resume decks. And for those who upgrade — give them premium-level power without premium pricing.
      </p>

      <p data-aos="fade-left">
        The roadmap ahead includes CreateArc 2.0 — AI personas, voice-to-slide input, multi-language output, team workspaces, offline mode, and intelligent analytics. This is not just a startup idea — this is a living movement. And every person who touches this journey becomes a part of something bigger.
      </p>

      <blockquote data-aos="flip-left">
        “When you’re building from nothing, every step counts twice.”
      </blockquote>

      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        I don’t know where this will end. But I know how it begins — with people like you, reading this, supporting builders like me. So, thank you. For being part of this journey. For believing in belief itself. For helping me turn a small dream into a bold declaration.
